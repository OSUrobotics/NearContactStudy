This folder contains Matlab code that can generate a checkerboard with a specified tile width(in pixels).
The tiles will be square. Also contained is code that will generate color keys for use with image registration.

The checkerboard is placed in the same folder as the script, and the color keys are placed in a folder called images
in the folder where script lives. The color keys are unique based on the number of colors in each tile, allowing them
to be unique even with rotation.

GIMP was used to modify the checkerboard image and paste the color keys onto it. Was also used to generate a red circle that serves as a calibration/validation point. Added after that was a blue rectangle for the box location, and a polar graph for positioning and orienting the objects in experiment.
